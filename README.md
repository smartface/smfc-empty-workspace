A “Hello World” [Smartface](https://www.smartface.io) workspace, using modern JavaScript.

## About

This is a fork of <https://github.com/smartface/smfc-empty-workspace> to add ES6/7+ support and (*possibly*) a hint of React.

This is currently an **experimental** repository. Use it at your own risk.

## Installation

Make sure you’ve cloned this repository in the [**Smartface Cloud IDE**](https://cloud.smartface.io/Home/Index).

Once you are inside the **Smartface Cloud IDE**, update the linux packages and also install a recent version of the Node.JS runtime as follows:

```
sudo apt-get update
nvm install v7.2.0
```

Then verify your Node.JS version:

```
node --version
v7.2.0
```

After that install required modules:

```
npm install
```

## Dependencies

As stated above, you need to clone this repository in the **Smartface Cloud IDE**. You will also need to do an `npm install` (*see the section above*). Other than those, everything else is handled by the Smartface runtime.

## Before Running the App in Your Device

Make sure that your code is in good shape by running the linter:

```
npm run lint
```

When you don’t see anything in the output, it means that your code is in good shape.

Remember: No news is good news.

If you, however, see a warning like the following, then you probably will need to fix it:

```
 9:36  error  Parsing error: Unexpected token, expected ,

   7 | import tr from 'languages/tr';
   8 |
>  9 | const lang = i18n(  de, fi, en, tr ] );
     |                                    ^
  10 |
  11 | export default lang;
  12 |

✖ 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
```

Linter warning are most of the time self-descriptive, and helpful. In the above case for instance, we have forgotten to add an `[` to the variable definition on line 9; — it should have been `const lang = i18n( [ de, fi, en, tr ] );` instead (node the extra `[` after the `( ` );

After you fix all the warning now you can build your JavaScript:

```
npm run build
```

When the above command finishes successfully; your repository is ready to be run on the device.
