An empty workspace template to be used in the smartface.io Cloud projects https://www.smartface.io/cloud/

## About

This is a “Hello World” [smartface.io](https://www.smartface.io) workspace, using modern JavaScript; it started as a fork of <https://github.com/smartface/smfc-empty-workspace> to add React and ES6/7+ support.

## Installation

Make sure you’ve cloned this repository in the [**smartface.io Cloud IDE**](https://cloud.smartface.io/Home/Index).

Once you are inside the **smartface.io Cloud IDE**, update the linux packages and also install a recent version of the Node.JS runtime as follows:

```
sudo apt-get update
nvm install v7.2.0
```

Then verify your Node.JS version:

```
node --version
v7.2.0
```

After that install required modules:

```
npm install
```

## Dependencies

As stated above, you need to clone this repository in the [**smartface.io Cloud IDE**](https://cloud.smartface.io/Home/Index). You will also need to do an `npm install` (*see the section above*). Other than those, everything else is handled by the Smartface runtime.

## Before Running the App in Your Device

Make sure that your code is in good shape by running the linter:

```
npm run lint
```

After you fix all the lint warnings and errors (*if any*), you can build your app:

```
npm run build
```

When the above command finishes successfully; your repository is ready to be run on the device.

You can, for example, tap the “run on device” button on the [smartface.io](https://www.smartface.io) IDE and read the QR code with your iOS or Android device to run the native app on the device.

## Package Scripts

This demo application comes with some helper npm scripts.

* `npm run test`: Runs unit tests.
* `npm run watcn`: Runs a watcher task so that whenever you change your files the application a development build is generated.
* `npm run build`: Creates a production build.
* `npm run clean-build`: Purges all the dependencies, fetches fresh dependencies from the Internet, then executes `npm run build` (*this might take a couple of minutes*).
* `npm run pull-build`: Pulls the recent master branch, and executes runs `npm run clean-build` (*this might take a couple of minutes*).
* `npm run lint`: Verifies the correctness of your source code.

## Important Files and Folders

* **src**: The application source code.
* **scripts**: Transpiled source goes there; the files in this folder is autogenerated; DO NOT MODIFY them.
* **resources**: Contains localization assets.
* **bin**: Binaries that are used by the NPM scripts.
* **./package.json**: The package definition.
* **CHANGELOG.md**: A log of what has been done since the last version.
* **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Basically tells the collaborators to be nice to each other.
* **README.md**: This very file.
